# Maze Generation Algorithms UI

This project provides a JavaFX user interface for visualizing maze generation algorithms. It offers a variety of algorithms such as Aldous-Broder, Kruskal's, binary tree, and backtracking. The UI allows users to interactively generate mazes and visualize them.

## Features

- **Multiple Maze Generation Algorithms:** Choose from various maze generation algorithms, including Aldous-Broder, Kruskal's, binary tree, and backtracking.
- **Interactive UI:** The JavaFX UI provides an interactive interface for generating and visualizing mazes.
- **Grid Size Options:** Users can select grid sizes of either 20x20 or 40x40 to generate mazes of different complexities.

## Usage

1. Download the executable JAR file from [here](https://packagecloud.io/gchapidze/release).
   
2. Run the executable JAR file:
   ```bash
   java -jar maze-gen-<version>.jar

4. Select the desired maze generation algorithm and grid size from the UI.
5. Explore the generated maze and visualize the maze generation process.
